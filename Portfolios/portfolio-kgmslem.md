# Back to The Dungeon Portfolio

I introduce our game development project. It's the first project for me when i was a college student. I'm really happy to develop this game by my own effort. In this project, we've tried to use possibly less external libraries. We've developed a lot of game systems to improve skills dramatically. It's been a nice experience.
